# Login-and-Registration-System-C-
📖 Project Description

This project is a console-based Login and Registration System developed in C++, designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and file handling (if included). The system allows users to register new accounts, log in using existing credentials, and ensures basic input validation for secure access.
This project was created as part of my C++ learning and internship practice, focusing on real-world authentication logic.

🚀 Features

User Registration (Username & Password)
User Login Authentication
Input Validation
Menu-driven Interface
Simple and User-Friendly Console UI
Error handling for invalid credentials

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++
Concepts Used:
Functions
Conditional Statements
Loops
Strings
Basic Validation

📍 The Process

I started this project with the goal of understanding how real-world authentication systems work at a basic level. Instead of jumping into complex frameworks, I chose a console-based C++ approach to focus purely on logic. I began by designing a simple menu-driven flow, then gradually built registration and login functionality using conditional statements and functions. Along the way, I added input validation to handle incorrect credentials and improve reliability. This project helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and understand how user authentication works behind the scenes.

▶️ How to Run

Open the project in any C++ compiler (Dev-C++, CodeBlocks, Visual Studio, etc.)
Compile the .cpp file
Run the program
Choose options from the menu (Register / Login)
